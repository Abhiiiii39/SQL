This project involves creating a comprehensive supply chain database using SQL to manage suppliers, products, warehouses, shipments, inventory, and orders. The database is structured to store detailed information about suppliers, warehouses, products, shipments, orders, and their relationships. Key features include tables for managing supplier details, product information, warehouse capacities, inventory levels, and order details. Various queries are implemented to perform operations such as viewing supplier details, checking inventory levels, tracking shipments, managing orders, calculating total sales, and identifying low-stock products. Additionally, the project includes data manipulation queries for updating order statuses, inserting new records, and deleting outdated entries. This project demonstrates the creation and management of a relational database system for supply chain management, facilitating efficient tracking and reporting across various aspects of the supply chain process, from procurement to delivery.
